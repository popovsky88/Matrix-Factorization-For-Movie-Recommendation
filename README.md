# Matrix-Factorization-For-Movie-Recommendation

Four matrix factorization methods are used in this assignment: Basic Matrix Factorization
(Funk-SVD) [1] as the baseline model, Regularized Matrix Factorization for mitigating the over-
fitting problem, Bias-SVD Matrix Factorization [3] for mitigating the influence of bias of users
and movies toward the preference prediction, and SVD++ Matrix Factorization [4] for improving
prediction accuracy through utilization of implicit feedback factors.
