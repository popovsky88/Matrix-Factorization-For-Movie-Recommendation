# Matrix-Factorization-For-Movie-Recommendation

Implementation of matrix factorization methods for collabrative filtering: 

* Basic Matrix Factorization (Funk-SVD) as the baseline model
* Regularized Matrix Factorization for mitigating the over-fitting problem
* Bias-SVD Matrix Factorization for mitigating the influence of bias of users and movies toward the preference prediction
* SVD++ Matrix Factorization for improving prediction accuracy through utilization of implicit feedback factors.
